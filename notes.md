- helps to validate the output generated by LLMs
- so instead of just asking the LLM to give an aswer, we will clearly state that we want the answer to be structured in this format with the following schema. Pydantic then validates the LLM's output to ensure it matches the schema
- dependencies help you to validate the data that's going as an input to the LLM. You can also add it as a context to the system prompt so it helps in creating dynamic system prompts. For eg, if the `customer_id` is of type `string` and the input given for the `customer_id` is `int`, then it'll raise a `validationError`
- In order to use tools, you need to register them in pydantic AI. Most of times, you'll use `tool` decorator: There are a number of ways to register tools with an agent:
    - via the @agent.tool decorator — for tools that need access to the agent context
    - via the @agent.tool_plain decorator — for tools that do not need access to the agent context
    - via the tools keyword argument to Agent which can take either plain functions, or instances of Tool
- If let's say the customer_id entered by the user is not in the expected format, you can use the `ModelRetry` function to ask the LLM to self-correct the customer_id. The default retry count is 1 but can be altered using the `retries` parameter
